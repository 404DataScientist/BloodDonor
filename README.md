# Blood Donor Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes a **Blood Donor Dataset** to uncover insights about donor availability, distribution of blood groups, and demographic patterns across cities. The notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) uses Python’s data science stack for **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization**.

The analysis can help understand donor demographics, blood group availability, and potential gaps in donation supply.

## 📊 Features

* Load and explore the **Blood Donor Dataset** (`blood_donor_dataset.csv`).
* Perform **data grouping and summarization** by city and blood group.
* Generate insightful **visualizations**:

  * Distribution of blood groups
  * Donor availability breakdown
  * Donor count by city
  * Pie charts and bar plots for categorical distributions

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following:

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files (`notebook.ipynb` and `blood_donor_dataset.csv`).
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `notebook.ipynb`.
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
